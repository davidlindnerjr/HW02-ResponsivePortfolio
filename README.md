# HW02-ResponsivePortfolio

  For this assignment we were tasked with making a responsive portfolio using bootstrap. During the activity I became familiar with the Bootstrap grid system. It seemed very strange at first as I was more used to using css flexbox to make my pages reponsive. I came to realize that not only is Bootstrap gris similar to flexbox, but it is composed of flexbox attributes. Looking at it this way made it click a lot easier for me. 
  
  In Bootstrap grid content is wrapped around a container element that houses the rows and columns. Each row is composed of 12 columns and can be divided however seems fit (but must always add up to 12 for grid to work propery). You can specify the size of columns according to the size of the device the page is displayed on; hence making grid very useful for responsiveness.
  
  I had no idea what to put in the portfolio portion of my project. I didn't want to just throw in random placeholders; tha seemed lazy. So I put in three projetcs that I have been practicing with on the side:
  
  * A fan tribute page - "LC-TributePage"
  * A Pokemon Pokedex - "Pokedex-2.0"
  * A product landing page for Reign Energy Drinks - "product-landing-page"
  
  The actual Portfolio itself can be accessed through:
  
  * "index.html"
